## Step 5: Merge your pull request

_Nice work, friend :heart:! People will be reading your blog in no time!_

You can now [merge](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-glossary#merge)!

### :keyboard: Activity: Merge your changes

1. Merge your changes from `my-pages` into `main`. If you created the pull request in step 2, just open that pull request and click on **Merge pull request**. If you did not create the pull request earlier, you can do it now by following the instructions in [step 2](/.github/steps/2-configure-your-site.md).
1. (optional) Delete the branch `my-pages`.
1. Wait about 20 seconds then refresh this page (the one you're following instructions from). [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) will automatically update to the next step.
